## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
With inspiration from several trading and investors across the internet, the goal is to create a full stack application that I can deploy and use as a market trading platform but also a way to find new opportunities.

So far this is a fairly simple project with only limitted support for trading strategies. But I will continue to add more generic strategies and custom ones going forward. 

There are also plans to support options and algorithmic trading in the future. 

I would love to create a bot that trades throughout the day and posts it's trades/value on a live chart.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
This app is built on FastAPI and Uvicorn. To start a local Uvicorn server run:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Most development happens in the main.py file but there are other scripts to populate your database with stock data.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
This app is not ready for deployment as of yet, but to run it locally you need to populate a secrets.py file.

After creating the secrets.py file, you need to run a sequence of scripts to build oyur backend and database.

Run create_db.py to build your SQLite database and schema.
1. ```python create_db.py```

Run populate_stocks.py to populate the SQLite database with the ticker symbols and information about each company/etf/fund.

2. ```python populate_stocks.py```

Run populate_prices.py to gather the historical data for each symbol from the Alpaca API.

3. ```python populate_prices.py```
